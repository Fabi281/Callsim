# callsim
A repository for a highschool project.

To start and test the Application please follow the following Guide (VS-Code):

1. Open VS-Code and open the "callsim" Folder in the Explorer.

2. Open another Instance of VS-Code and open the "client" Folder in the "callsim" Folder

3. Start the Server by running the "CallSimApplication.java"

4. Start the Client by running "client.java"


Notes for Team:

1. The Naming of Classes and Variables in the Server Component is temporary and might be misleading as of now

2. I´ll (Fabian) will be fixing it. Until it is fixed please refrain yourself from working on the Server Component

3. You can customize the client component to your heart's content (build a GUI). There are examples on how to communicate with the server and start a websocket in the
client. The only actions as of now are "login" and "register" with persistence (saved to File). I´ll explain everything in more detail at the next meeting.
If you are not confident in working with websockets you can just copy the client and work on it seperatly or make a backup (generally not needed due to us 
working with Github).

4. If there are any questions contact me on Discord or Whats App

5. There probably are a LOT of Bugs especially in the Server Component. I´ll be working on those until the next Meeting (no new Actions or Features just Bugfixing
until then)
